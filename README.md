# algorithm-research

this repository is for practicing academic algorithms and testing self-developed algorithms. There are several files for different purpose

01 DataStructure :
	It contains self-made c++ data structure(graph and tree-related) for solving questions using tree and graph, not included in STL.
	and it also includes some data sturucture (using c). I customized this from existing sources from other people. it's only for
	practicing algorithms for personal uses.
		
02 SCPC(Samsung Collegiate Programming Cup) :
	It's for practicing algorithms questions for the book "Samsung software capability test".
    All this solution is made by me and it's for praparing SCPC(Samsung Collegiate Programming Cup)

03 Hackerrank :
	It's for practicing algorithm questions in website "Hackerrank." All solutions in this file is my personal solutions. (C++ most of it)

04 Leetcode :
	It's for practicing algorithm questions in website "Leetcode." All solutions in this file is my personal solutions. (C++ most of it)
