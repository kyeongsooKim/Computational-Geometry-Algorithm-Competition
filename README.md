# algorithm-research

this repository is for practicing academic algorithms and testing self-developed algorithms. There are several files for different purpose

01 DataStructure :
		It contains self-made c++ data structure(graph and tree-related) for solving questions using tree and graph, not included in STL.
		and it also includes some data sturucture (using c). I customized this from existing sources from other people. it's only for
		practicing algorithms for personal uses.
		
02 SCPC(Samsung Collegiate Programming Cup) :
		It's for practicing algorithms questions for the book "Samsung software capability test".
        All this solution is made by me and it's for praparing SCPC(Samsung Collegiate Programming Cup)
